## Colour Picker - JQuery

A short mini-project for myself to learn basic JQuery.

### Instructions

  Enter a colour into the text-box and see it displayed in the preview section.
  If you like the colour click 'Add to favourites' and it will be save in the block of colour on the right-hand side of the page.
  Up to 16 colours can be saved.

  NOTE: Only simple colours can be added in the text-box at this time.
